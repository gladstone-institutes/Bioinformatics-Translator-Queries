# Bioinformatics-Translator-Queries
This repo is used to track Translator queries relevant to the Bioinformatics Core, mostly from Bioinformatics Core projects. Relevant questions might be in the form of "is gene x related to disease y" or "how does drug x interact with gene z". Please enter your question as an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gladstone-institutes/Bioinformatics-Translator-Queries/issues).


Queries can be run in multiple interfaces (see labels):
 - [ARAX](https://arax.ncats.io/)
 - [Translator UI](https://ui.transltr.io/)
 - [Translator PathFinder UI](https://ui.ci.transltr.io/pathfinder)
